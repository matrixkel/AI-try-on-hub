Virtual Try-On
This project is a Virtual Try-On System that allows users to visualize how different items (such as clothes, accessories, or makeup) look on them without physically trying them on. It's designed to enhance the shopping experience and make decision-making easier.

Features
Upload a photo or use a live camera feed.
Overlay virtual items (clothing, accessories, etc.) on the user.
Realistic alignment and fitting based on body proportions.
Easy-to-use interface for a smooth experience.
How It Works
Input: Users upload an image or enable their camera.
Processing: The system uses advanced image processing and AI techniques to align virtual items with the userâ€™s photo.
Output: The user sees a realistic visualization of the virtual item on them.
