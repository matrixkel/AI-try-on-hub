# Virtual Try-On

This project is a **Virtual Try-On System** that allows users to see how different clothing items or accessories look on them without physically trying them on. It enhances the online shopping experience by providing a more interactive and realistic preview of products.

## Features
- Upload a photo or use a live camera feed.
- Overlay virtual clothing or accessories.
- Automatic body alignment for a realistic fit.
- User-friendly interface.

## How It Works
1. **Input**: The user uploads an image or enables the camera.
2. **Processing**: AI and image processing align the virtual items with the user's image.
3. **Output**: The user sees a realistic visualization of the item on them.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)
- Webcam or uploaded image

## Installation
